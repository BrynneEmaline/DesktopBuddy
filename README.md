 **tkinter is a GUI I will use for:**
 - creating main window
 - display buddy
 - handle user interactions
 - animations and movement
 - keeping the display window on top of other windows
 
**organizing my project:**
 - main: entrypoint
 - ui: handles the tkinter GUI
 - animations: logic for moving the buddy
 - config: stores global settings for screen size etc
 - assets: images and other assets for buddy
 - README: project documentation, is a markdown file

**python syntax as I learn it:** 
-__init__() : python constructor

root : Tkinter naming convention for the main window 

def : used to define a function. 
    Example: 
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

'self' : similar to java's 'this', but required even without redundant naming. 
All instance variables must use self.
